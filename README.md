This project explores using a knn machine learning algorithm to classify samples.  Data: USGS rock grab samples from upper Lynn Canal.  Labels: protolith derived from Winchester Floyd discrimination plot.  Accuracy is low right now and can be improved by going through the metadata as the Winchester Floyd plot shows inconsistency in the trace element assays.
